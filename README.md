# Work-Day-Scheduler

This is a simple work day scheduler. With this scheduler, you wll be able to see your day unfold within the time blocks. 


* The time at the top updates with current local times. 

* When the time changes, the colors of the blocks will too. 
        > Grey = that time has already passed 
        > Red = the current hour block 
        > Green = the rest of the day ahead

* When an even is entered within the input box, it is saved in that box.
